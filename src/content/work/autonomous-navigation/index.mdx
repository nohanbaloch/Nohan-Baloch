# Autonomous Navigation System

Designed for the challenging environments of space and planetary surfaces, this system provides a full stack for autonomous movement of rovers and spacecraft.

## Key Modules

- **Perception**: Processes environment data to identify obstacles and landmarks.
- **Path Planning**: Generates optimal routes while avoiding hazards in real-time.
- **Control**: Translates planned paths into precise movement commands for hardware.

## Tech Stack

- **Logic**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- **Research**: Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and prototyping.
