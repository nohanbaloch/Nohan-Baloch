# AURA

AURA is a local cognitive AI companion built for Windows. It focuses on privacy, transparency, and a robust cognitive loop that distinguishes it from standard chatbots.

## Core Concepts

- **Cognitive Loop**: Perceive → Interpret → Reflect → Decide → Act → Remember.
- **Local-First**: All processing happens on the user's machine, ensuring maximum privacy.
- **Advanced Memory**: Implements both short-term and persistent long-term memory using SQLite and semantic embeddings.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: CustomTkinter
- **Core logic**: Python
- **Memory**: SQLite, Semantic Embeddings
- **Testing**: Pytest
